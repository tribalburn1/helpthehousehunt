# helpthehousehunt

This is the repository for  some assets from my Android App HelpTheHouseHunt
- [Help the House Hunt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sdei.app.helpthehousehuntfree)

##Description
Opening up the source code and assets for everyone that might be intersted in a semi-complex Android App.  It's a little old, but you may be able to use/re-use some of the assets.  Or better yet, update my app for me.  :)   perhaps make an iOS version?

## Instructions
I am building this repository slowly, give me some time, I have a lot to chew on.

1. You don't talk about FightClub
2. You don't talk about FightClub

## More Stuff
Happy coding!
